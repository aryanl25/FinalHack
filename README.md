*Project Overview:*

Our team participated in a hackathon with the challenge of creating a functional product using generative AI in the medical diagnosis sector. We successfully developed a custom generative AI medical assistance chatbot to address this challenge.

*Development Process:*

1. *Python-Based Initial Attempt:* We began by exploring a Python-based approach to create an encyclopedia-style bot that could learn and provide precise responses based on user interactions. We even provided the code for this Python bot.

2. *Data Limitation Challenge:* However, we quickly realized that to make the Python bot function at the desired scale, it would require a vast amount of data beyond the scope of our project. This realization led us to look for alternative solutions.

3. *AI Software Integration:* To overcome the data limitations, we decided to integrate an AI software solution. This software allowed us to rapidly expand the chatbot's knowledge base with the necessary medical information.

4. *Utilization of Botpress.com:* We leveraged an online platform called botpress.com to create our chatbot. This platform provided a no-code approach, enabling us to customize our neural network for the chatbot. We also integrated essential web citations and references into its knowledge base.

5. *Worqhat API Integration:* We made efforts to integrate the Worqhat API using a hook function and provided the relevant code as part of our project.

*Implementation Highlights:*

6. *Integration with Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital:* As a practical demonstration of our chatbot's capabilities, we chose to integrate it with the website of Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital, a well-known medical institution in Pune.

7. *Front-End Development:* We implemented the chatbot as a bubble overlay on the hospital's website using front-end development technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can easily activate the chatbot by hovering over the bubble, situated in the bottom right corner of the screen.

8. *Comprehensive Knowledge Base:* Our chatbot is backed by an extensive knowledge base sourced from reputable medical sites like WebMD, Wikipedia, and governmental and educational websites specializing in medical information.

9. *Hospital-Specific Information:* Additionally, the chatbot incorporates data from the live Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital website. While it cannot apply this data directly, it can schedule appointments for users, promote the hospital's treatments, and provide comprehensive information about the institution.

10. *Identity and Machine Learning:* The chatbot possesses a sense of identity and self-awareness. It knows that it was developed by a team of three developers from MIT and can articulate its name, capabilities, and responsibilities. Furthermore, it adapts and learns from user interactions, exemplifying core principles of machine learning and AI.

11. *Response Time Clarification:* As a cloud-based service, the chatbot occasionally experiences brief delays in responses, typically not exceeding 10-15 seconds.

*Future Outlook:*

12. We view this project as extending beyond the scope of a hackathon and into the realm of business and practical development. We have created a fully functional and ready-to-integrate solution that could be seamlessly integrated into the live website of Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital or similar institutions, offering significant potential for real-world application and benefit.
